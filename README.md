What is Charles Babbage machine?
Analytical Engine, generally considered the first computer, designed and partly built by the English inventor Charles Babbage in the 19th century (he worked on it until his death in 1871). Charles Babbage (1791-1871), computer pioneer, designed the first automatic computing engines. He invented computers but failed to build them. The first complete Babbage Engine was completed in London in 2002, 153 years after it was designed.

The Analytical Engine was a general-purpose, completely program-controlled, mechanical digital computer with no human intervention.
The store intended to be large enough to contain 1,000 50-digit numbers, which was more than any computer constructed before 1960 could store.
No evidence is there that anyone had ever thought about, let alone attempted to create, such a machine before Babbage.

How was Analytical Engine made?
There is no evidence that anyone before Babbage had ever conceived of such a device, let alone attempted to build one. The machine was designed to consist of four components: the mill, the store, the reader, and the printer. These components are the essential components of every computer today.

How fast is Analytical Engine?
Computers also measure their speeds by clock cycles per second, measured in Hertz. The Analytical Engine could run at about 7 Hertz, which given its mechanical construction was very fast (“Babbage Analytical Engine…”).
