What is Charles Babbage machine?
Analytical Engine, generally considered the first computer, designed and partly built by the English inventor Charles Babbage in the 19th century (he worked on it until his death in 1871). Charles Babbage (1791-1871), computer pioneer, designed the first automatic computing engines. He invented computers but failed to build them. The first complete Babbage Engine was completed in London in 2002, 153 years after it was designed.

The Analytical Engine was a general-purpose, completely program-controlled, mechanical digital computer with no human intervention.
The store intended to be large enough to contain 1,000 50-digit numbers, which was more than any computer constructed before 1960 could store.
No evidence is there that anyone had ever thought about, let alone attempted to create, such a machine before Babbage.
